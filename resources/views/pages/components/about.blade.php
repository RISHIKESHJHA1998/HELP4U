                <p> We provide you with the most convenient and easy way to donate those items that are just lying at some corner of your house, gathering dust and taking up some much-needed space.</p>

                <p>It's time to donate them and give those books, unused medicine , clothes etc a new life.</p>

                <p>There are many benefits to donating your old stuff to NGOs . Items you donate support many great charitable causes. </p>

                <p>Keep your stuff out of a landfill.</p>

                <p>The "feel good" factor - we all know he happiness we get by spreading happiness.</p>
